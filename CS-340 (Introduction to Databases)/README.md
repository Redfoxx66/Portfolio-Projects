# Portfolio Assignment: Intro to Databases

This directory holds the code generated for CS 340 Introduction to Database class final (portfolio) project. The criteria/requirements and general directions for the project can be found in the following sections and is recreated from the original canvas page given.

## Aim

This is the Final step where you submit a working website URL along with your DDQ and DMQ files, server-side and client-side code and the PDF. There is no peer or group review for this Step. You will format your report professionally incorporating changes to previous assignments.  

This assignment is designated as a program "portfolio assignment." You are encouraged to publicize it as part of your portfolio. Remember your school-hosted database will be deleted at the end of the term, so consider what to do after the term as well. For example, a video of  the functioning website, putting your final project PDF on LinkedIn,  or hosting the site (MySQL database, HTML pages and code) on a third party hosting platform are all examples of how to make your portfolio assignment available after the term.

## Deliverable

A **ZIP** archive containing 5 THINGS as described below in detail.

The zip file should be named like `â€‹projectgroupX_stepX_DRAFT/FINAL.zip`, e.g., `ProjectGroup42_Step3_FINAL.zip`.

1. **All the source code for your Project**: This includes files containing CSS, HTML, JS and the code for server-side platform that you decided to use. For any external libraries, you may include the package.json (or the equivalent) instead of including all the files for the library. Be sure to remove your username and password from the dbcon (or equivalent) file. **Points will be deducted from your grade if you do not include the source code**.
2. **A PDF file containing** (in the given order):
   - 1 page (max) summary of feedback and changes made to this Project from the initial version until now.
   - An updated version of your Project Outline, Database Outline, ERD, and Schema.
   - Screen captures of each of the UI pages on your website.
     - Add a title immediately above each Screen capture which explains the CRUD step. E.g. "READ/BROWSE/DISPLAY Customers page" or "CREATE/INSERT/ADD NEW Invoice page."

3. The **URL** of **your hosted, functioning project website** on the first page of the PDF as well as a comment on your submission. You will need to prefix the URL with `http://` or `https://` If you want your web app to be tested only on a specific browser, let the graders know by indicating on: a) the first page of the PDF in noticeable fashion AND b) on every page of your website.
4. The `.SQL` **file containing your Data Definition Queries** and the **sample data**
5. The `.SQL` **file containing your Data Manipulation Queries**.

The project website should be up and running until the last day of term.
