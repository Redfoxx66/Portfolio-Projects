# More information on Final Project

## General Information

We decided to make a movie database website similar to IMDB.

The links to our github project board that we used to track issues and development to keep ourselves organized and informed is not accessible due to a private repository. Since it was an automatic school assigned repository I have no permission access to reassign the repository and I am unable to move the project board as well I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Similiarly I no longer have access to the links for our meetings via documents so that can't be accessed either.

**Reminder**: As this was a group project each one of us had different responsiblities aside from working together and helping eachother when necessary. *It may be important to note that I did often help others remotely and they would just commit that code*.

For instance I helped:

- keep us organized
- make sure the routes were working/fixed and they didn't interfere/break eachother
- making example data and tests the others could use

## My Main Contributions

- Setting up the navbar
- Initial database setup
- Movie database
- Genre data type
- Movies complex data type

## Write Up

Below I have recreated the writeup I made rather than uploading the PDF.

### Question 1

I was in charge of the movie data type. With that I made the genre data type and set up the links between movies genres and the actor data type.

### Question 2

As mentioned before the links I would have provided here are no longer valid.

### Question 3

I started off trying to use Ajax to do custom filtering/sorting/search for my movies objects but it proved to be a topic that was incredibly difficult to find information on that would help me link it all together. So in the end it was too much of a challenge and I had to choose something else after trying jquery and some other new techniques that weren’t working. So I switched to making a json web request API. I realize now if I had some more time I would be able to implement both of them. I had to learn some new techniques for communicating with the API routes and json parsing. I also had to change up a bunch of code for implementing the CRUD operations. Getting all of the code working how I expected and learning how to handle some of the unclear errors by myself. Unfortunately there was some struggle in particular with getting the other data types to link up properly and in the end for some reason my code to update the actors when they were removed from the movie isn’t in a working state. I left as many comments as I could to help things easier to understand.
