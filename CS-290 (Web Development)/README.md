# CS 290 (Web Development) Code Location

Since my portfolio project for CS 290 to develop a full stack web application was a group project I decided to take the school generated repository with all of our work and commits and migrate it into a seperate branch to keep the repository clean.

The code is located in a seperate branch [**CS_290**](https://github.com/Redfoxx66/Portfolio-Projects/tree/CS_290) for now and can be viewed there.

*If there are any problems with this that is brought to my attention I will happily merge it into the main branch*.
