# Portfolio Projects

This repository holds projects that are allowed to be shown publicly to demonstrate my skills. Many of them are projects that are part of a class.

## Organization

Each project that makes up my portfolio is self contained in its own directory/folder in this repository. I have decided to do this in order to keep all of the code that makes up my portfolio in one place.

## Copyright information
